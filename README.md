Some simple cases to learn libpcap
==================================

Start with capture.c it's commented by the original author (Martin Casado (https://github.com/lsanotes/libpcap-tutorial)
so it's a good point to get started.

I've tried to change the variable names to something more meaningful and
using a more concious way of indentation and program structure.

Added a Makefile to make it easier to try out the examples.
